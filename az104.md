## [az container](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/container#az_container_export)
A container group is a collection of containers that get scheduled on the same host machine. The containers in a container group share a lifecycle, resources, local network, and storage volumes. It's similar in concept to a pod in Kubernetes. Multi-container groups currently support only Linux containers. Two common ways to deploy a multi-container group: use a Resource Manager template or a YAML file. can export the configuration to a YAML file by using the Azure CLI command az container export. To enable external clients to reach a container within the group, you must expose the port on the IP address and from the container.
