# [Get started with Azure DevOps](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/paths/evolve-your-devops-practices/?source=learn)
With Azure DevOps, you can build, test, and deploy any application, either to the cloud or on premises. 
## [Assess your existing software development process](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/assess-your-development-process/?source=learn&ns-enrollment-type=learningpath&ns-enrollment-id=learn.azdo.evolve-your-devops-practices)   
The first step to setting up a DevOps practice is to assess your current process. This means analyzing:
1.	Your existing artifacts, like deployment packages and NuGet, as well as your container repositories.
2.	Your existing test management tools.
3.	Your existing work management tools.
4.	Recommending migration and integration strategies.

>Creating a value stream map, or VSM, helps you analyze your current release cycle process. The purpose of a VSM is to visually show where in the process a team creates value and where there's waste. The goal is to arrive at a process that delivers maximum value to the customer with minimum waste. A VSM can help you pinpoint those areas that either don't contribute any value or that actually reduce the value of the product.
